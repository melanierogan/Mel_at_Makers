# Day 2

Workshop on constructors and encapsulation
- Constructor function, prototype, encapsulation definitions after day 1
- Constructor: like a class in ruby, use new, initialise with `this`
- prototype: like method `object.prototype.name` bit like def method in ruby
- encapsulation: splitting concerns, limiting scope, grouping associated state and behaviour
- prototypical inheritance (cats, cat and cat2)
- workshop excercises on constructor and prototype (https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-5/encapsulation_with_constructor_and_prototype_pattern)
