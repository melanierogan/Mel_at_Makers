#Day 4

- You write it with a function so that it ensures it gets a response to save it to that function 
before it goes any further

- a callback allows the get some time before it gets a response, so it takes the time and saves it to the function and runs

- envelope of instructions, don't open it until you get a response

```
js
<script>
      $.get("https://async-workshops-api.herokuapp.com/people", function(peopleResponse) {
        $("#person").html(peopleResponse[0].name);
      });
</script>
```

- `.get` always takes two arguments, the url and the function
- testing frameworks like jasmine more so (doubling, etc). Cheatsheet
