# Day 5

- Takeaway challenge today! Woooo!
- Be careful how you set up a test, when using subject, don't put it in a string e.g.
```
describe Class do
end
```

not

```
describe 'Class' do
end
```

- `rubocop -a` correct the offences
- Twilio fun times...watch out when using newer version of twilio-ruby with older versions of ruby
