# Day 3

- Learning about delegation and the true use of a class (CEO example)
- Working solo on checkout project
- When you want to show the describe/context/it of tests you need to edit `.rspec` to contain the below (spec_helper should already be there):

```
ruby
--format documentation
--color
--require spec_helper
```

- delegation and trying to extract classes from one big document (todo list)
- worked with Adrian on the oystercard project
