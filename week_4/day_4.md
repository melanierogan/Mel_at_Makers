# Day 4

- No workshops today (trying to catch up on things)
- refactoring code from yesterday in oystercard, see notes in the repo on what to feed in and set_station method
https://github.com/melanierogan/oyster_card_challenge
- Paired with Kelvin, who did have set_station in place to make step 15 easier.
- We worked out the next two steps (15 and 16) including the use of `abs` to change a negative number to a positive one

- watched the presentation of the final projects of the other cohort, some really great stuff. Lots with apis (a student website)
