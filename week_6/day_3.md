# Day 3

- One table for each object (relational database) 
e.g. bikes, docking stations example
- Always has an id, as integer
- Take CRC card and apply to tables
- Boolean TRUE or FALSE for working
- One to many relationships (ds --> bunch of bikes)
- One docking station, many bikes
- Foreign key in bikes table, relation to a rown in another table...foreign key is docking_station_id. The id is linked to docking_station table id
- many to many relationship...practice (there is an application here for the message board app to have another table for messages, and another for comments)
