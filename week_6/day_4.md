# Day 4

- EI workshop at 11 (amiable, expressive, logical, drivers and what type you are and what type your pair is)
- Solo work on blog challenge (build a blog with sinatra and PSQL)
- Good review on ruby map method: https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/10/ruby-map-method/
- Pairing with Manesha and learning some bootstrap and css
- debugging bookmarks which is a bit all over the shop
- Got blog running, then tried to just deploy to Heroku without reading much...then installed puma to help and broke everything
so more debugging for me!
