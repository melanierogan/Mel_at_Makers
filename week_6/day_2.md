# Day 2

- Did sqlzoo in the morning
- Further query practice with Sam's workshop and this repo, got stuck on the second half where there's an each holding up things in the display: https://github.com/samjones1001/makers-sql-session
- Paired with Ollie in the afternoon, learned about how you must use `result.map` so you can iterate through the results of `PG` and get the urls
