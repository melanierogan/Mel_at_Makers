# Things that I get stuck on 

- how do you make something private if it is initialized in a class
- how do i stop a feature test sending a text but still have it add toward test coverage
- review getting stuck when doubling a class that has another class initialized
- dependency injection practice
- why use rack instead of shotgun? or the other way around?
